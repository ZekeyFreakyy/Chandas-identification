## 📝 What is Chandas-identification?

Chandas-identification is a simple application that helps you recognize Sanskrit poetic meters just by typing or pasting Devanagari text. Sanskrit poetry often uses specific rhythm patterns called meters or chandas. This tool uses artificial intelligence to find these patterns quickly and explain how it makes its decision. 

You do not need any programming skills to use it.
